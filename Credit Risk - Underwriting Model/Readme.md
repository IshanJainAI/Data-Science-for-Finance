# Objective 
Credit Risk Modeling (Underwriting model) -> to predict Probability of Default (PD)

# Business Problem
Banks and financial institues use Credit Risk modeling to estimate Probability of Default and Expected Loss. 

A credit risk is risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments. 

A loan is in default when the lending agency is certain that a loan will not be repaid (i.e. bills not paid in due time).

Predicting default beforehand is useful to estimate expected loss where

**Expected Loss = Probability of Default (PD) * Exposure at Default (EAD) * Loss Given Default (LGD)**

Here, EAD = $ amount outstanding at time of default and LGD is ratio of exposure against any recovery from loss

e.g. if, after default, the exposure amount is 100 and the debt is sold at 20, then LGD is 80%

Our focus here is to calculate PD given Application and Behavioral data of the lending agency's customers.

 
# Methodology
1) Python Libraries - pandas, numpy, scikit learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost
2) Dataset - 32500 customer's loan data from a bank. 
3) EDA and Pre-processing - Correlation, Visualization, Transformation, Misisng values, Outliers etc.
4) ML model - Logistics Regression, XGBoost
5) Performance Evaluation - Typical Classification Performance Criteria
