# Objective 
Loan Prediction Model - to whom a bank should give Personal Loans (Supervised Learning using Classification).


# Business Problem
Banks and financial institues use loan prediction model to minimize the risk of default by identifying customers to give the loans. 

It is done by predicting if the loan can be given to that person on the basis of various parameters like 
credit score, income, age, marital status, gender, etc. 

The prediction model not only helps the applicant but also helps the bank by minimizing the risk and reducing the number of defaulters.
 
 
# Methodology
1) Python Libraries - pandas, numpy, scikit learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost
2) Dataset - 5000 customer data from a bank. 
3) EDA - Correlation, Visualization, Transformation, Misisng values, Outliers etc.
4) ML model - Multi-layer ANN model with Relu activation. 
5) Performance Evaluation - Typical Classification Performance Criteria
